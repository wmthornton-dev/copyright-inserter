# Copyright Inserter

The Copyright Inserter is a VS Code extension that adds a copyright and license header into editing files. The development was inspired by [addlicense](https://github.com/google/addlicense) and [autogen](https://github.com/mbrukman/autogen) tools and comes to simplify the process of adding copyright and license into files during development by integrating with one of the most popular development environments.

The extension supports the following licenses:

**Copyright**

## Features

When the extension command is invoked in the editor, a copyright and license header is inserted at the top of the file.
The extension captures the current language mode of the editor and uses the language configuration to decide where to insert the header and how to decorate it.
The header is usually inserted into the first line. However, for language modes such as `shellscript`, `html` and `xml` which has mandatory declarations in the first line, the header is inserted next after the declaration line.
The header is decorated using language's comment syntax. If the language has both block and line comments, the extension will use the block comments for the decoration.

The extension can be invoked by typing `insert header` or `Copyright: insert header` in the [VSCode Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette). No key binding is defined at the moment.
